#StarterGame

The main purpose for this game is to get all of the developers working together. The plan is to use this repository as a platform to learn about the development cycle. That way we can plan and execute efficiently. 

We will be making a simple game. What kind of game? We do not know yet. This will hopefully be the start of some great times, and even better software.
