#StarterGame

The main purpose for this game is to get all of the developers working together. The plan is to use this repository as a platform to learn about the development cycle. That way we can plan and execute efficiently. 

We will be making a simple game. What kind of game? We do not know yet. This will hopefully be the start of some great times, and even better software.

###Some Questions we need to think about:

- What platform are we developing for? - Since this is our first stab at this we are gonna go web.
- What language(s) are we going to use? - Since we are going web we are gonna use HTML and JavaScript (P5.js)
- What kind of game are we going to make? - Some form of platformer. I am sure it will evolve once we pick up speed.

(Feel free to add other questions that you think are **relevant**)
