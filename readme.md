#StarterGame

The main purpose for this game is to get all of the developers working together. The plan is to use this repository as a platform to learn about the development cycle. That way we can plan and execute efficiently. 

We will be making a simple game. What kind of game? We do not know yet. This will hopefully be the start of some great times, and even better software.

###Some Questions we need to think about:

- What platform are we developing for?
- What language(s) are we going to use?
- What kind of game are we going to make?

(Feel free to add other that you think are **relevant**)
